# Softwareengineering_FlappingBalls
This game is all about flapping balls. Have fun!

## Why?
Why not?

## How can I play?
Go to [this url](https://www.flappingballs.com).

## Why is this repository private?
So nobody can steal our monkey code!

## How do we manage our branches and when do we merge?
For every new Feature we create a new branch. Before merging the branch with our main, another dev has to review and accept it.
